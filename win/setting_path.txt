Copied all the mpv stuff to the "C:\Program Files\mpv" folder

Run the installer as admin

Open up the "System Environment Variables"

Click "Environment Variables"

The bottom half is all System environment variables. That's what we want.

Find "Path" in the list and hit "Edit"

Add "C:\Program Files\mpv" to the list and hit Ok on all the windows

If this was done correctly, cmd will be able to call mpv when you type "mpv" and hit enter
